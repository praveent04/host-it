## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <domain> <ip> [-g group]` | Add a domain mapping to the hosts file |
| `remove <domain> [-g group]` | Remove a domain mapping from the hosts file |
| `list [-g group]` | List all HOST-IT managed entries or from a specific group |
| `status` | Show hosts file information and HOST-IT entries count |
| `help` | Display help information |

## Examples

### Add a local development domain

```bash
host-it add myproject.local 127.0.0.1
```

### Add multiple domains to a group

```bash
host-it add "app.local,api.local,admin.local" 127.0.0.1 -g projectx
```

### List all entries in a specific group

```bash
host-it list -g projectx
```

### Remove all domains in a group

## Configuration

HOST-IT stores its configuration in `~/.host-it/config.json`. You can manually edit this file if needed, but it's recommended to use the CLI commands.

## How It Works

HOST-IT adds special comment markers to your hosts file to identify and manage its entries. This allows it to safely add, remove, and update entries without affecting other content in your hosts file.

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or higher
- Admin/sudo privileges (only when modifying the hosts file)
